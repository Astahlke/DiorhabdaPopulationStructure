Goals are to
* Quantify prevalence and levels of hybridization among the four introduced species and
* Examine the consequences of population bottlenecks and admixture on genome-wide diversity across broad, landscape-wide expansion fronts and the hybrid zone.

Most work is performed on the IBEST cluster usually crick or watson.
